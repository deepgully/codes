<h2>Object expressions</h2>
<p>Read about <a href="http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/object-declarations.html">object expressions</a> that play the same role in Kotlin as anonymous classes in Java.</p>
<p>Add an object expression that provides a comparator to sort a list in a descending order using java.util.Collections class. In Kotlin you use Kotlin library extensions instead of java.util.Collections, but this example is still a good demonstration of mixing Kotlin and Java code.</p>
